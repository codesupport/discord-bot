# Contributing

Before contributing towards a pull request, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/codesupport/discord-bot/issues/new) stating:
- What functionality you are adding?
- Why you are adding this functionality (what's the benefit)?

Discussion will then take place on the GitHub Issue by members of the community allowing them to express their thoughts.
However, the final decision will be made by the [CodeSupport Discord](https://codesupport.dev/discord) moderation team. 

We advise you to only start working on the functionality once your Issue receives the "[accepted](https://github.com/codesupport/discord-bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccepted)" label.
